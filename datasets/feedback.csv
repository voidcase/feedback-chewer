The I311 undulator control is a bit simplistic (using a lookup table for gap positions should maybe be an option for advanced users). A simple safety check to prevent users from making long undulator moves while there is a taper would be advisable.

It would be nice to have the option to measure beam flux using either a photodiode OR a retractable gold mesh when the beam spot profile isn't of particular importance to an experiment. 

Automated control of the exit slit and the analyzer entrance slit would be nice user-facing features.

Two extra-long injections and a beam loss interrupted our measurements. I remember these problems plagued synchrotrons in the last century, but these days they are rather unusual. Hence my reduced rating for the ring this time.

The software does the job, but is overly complicated, on one hand, and too rigid, on the other. It does not allow the visitors to specify a *single* data collection directory for a visit, trying to create per-project and per-date directories instead (and crashing the process...). The single per-visit root would make backups and data checks much easier. All other attributes (metadata such as project, user, etc.) should be recorded in a database and/or in XML/JSON/key-value pair text files.

The dataset should be identified by a *single* identifier, supplied by the *user* (*not* by the beamline software), and used to name dataset directory and images within. Now we have to duplicate the ID, which is tedious, distracting and error prone.

The beamline processing software clutters our processing directories with undocumented and sometimes redundant large files -- this wastes disk space, backup time and puts extra burden on data management. It also launches processes on our data that are nowhere specified and interfere with our data processing. It would be better if we as users would have full control on what software is started on our collected data and when, and what files are recorded (there is no need to store a file and its gzipped version, or TMP files in the PROCESSED_DATA tree). Thus, the software could be improved along these lines, IMHO.","Great users service, thank you!

At all the occasions where we have called, Christopher has either solved the problem over the phone or he has come in and fixed the needs. Thank you very much.
The beamline quality has improved very much since our last data collection in October 2013. We have also been here for teh BIOSAS course feb 2014, and again we experience improvements since Feb. Clearly, the strategy for upgrading the user-friendliness of the beamline is working. We have collected more than 2x the amount of data compared to previous visits, AND in general the reproducibility of the data is much higher than before. 
We have experienced the following kind of bugs and problems:
Robot stuck: Happens when the water/air arm does not return after use. Solved by resetting software and hardware. Happened maybe 10 times.

Lost connection between software and hardware for robot: Discovered one bug, if placing a comment in the comment line (with robot load) the program loses connection after first exposure (cannot open shutter again).
If changing the robot-speed also some times the connection was lost. 
We lost connection to SPEC. Solved by restarting everything (aided by Christopher over the phone).

Over Sunday night, the general stability of the incoming beam was lowered. It appeared to be local (instrument), not the ring. We did not discover the source of the problem. We do notice that the robot, when going at full speed, can cause some of the problems.
During the rest of the experiment it was much better, and in general the stability was significnatly higher than at earlier visits, very much appreciated (since we need to compare data over many hours).
Pipeline crashed a couple of times, but when it works it is very convenient. It ensures that the user can follow the data collection and hence optimize the data colelction prior to departure, so it is very much appreciated that the pipeline is installed.
Suggestions, please see below.

Please note, again, that the overall quality of the beamline has improved significantly!
BTW we also appreciate the efficient air-driven temperature control on the sample plates.","More tips in the lab would be convenient. 
Better centrifuge (higher speed) would be beneficial before SAXS measurements

DUO has given some problems, we tried to submit the user form several times before it worked, but now things are settled (by hte kind assistance of Ralf)

DUO: here we have tried to submit this user form 3 times, but the DUO does not save it - asks us to 'come back later' - ","General remark: 
By the end of hte experiment, we ran out of yellow tips and plates for the robot. With the current speed of experiments, it must be anticipated that the users spend more of these things.

Our overall success: very good. Incomparably better than earlier, now that the stability of the beamline has improved so much. Appaarantyl also the scaling to the intensity has improved (new diodes?) and definitely the overall stability is improved with the robot (as compared to manual filling).
The speed has significantly increased, adn the option to follow the data while collecting optimizes the output very much.",N.A.,25/04/2014

Two extra-long injections and a beam loss interrupted our measurements. I remember these problems plagued synchrotrons in the last century, but these days they are rather unusual. Hence my reduced rating for the ring this time.

The software does the job, but is overly complicated, on one hand, and too rigid, on the other. It does not allow the visitors to specify a *single* data collection directory for a visit, trying to create per-project and per-date directories instead (and crashing the process...). The single per-visit root would make backups and data checks much easier. All other attributes (metadata such as project, user, etc.) should be recorded in a database and/or in XML/JSON/key-value pair text files.

The dataset should be identified by a *single* identifier, supplied by the *user* (*not* by the beamline software), and used to name dataset directory and images within. Now we have to duplicate the ID, which is tedious, distracting and error prone.

The beamline processing software clutters our processing directories with undocumented and sometimes redundant large files -- this wastes disk space, backup time and puts extra burden on data management. It also launches processes on our data that are nowhere specified and interfere with our data processing. It would be better if we as users would have full control on what software is started on our collected data and when, and what files are recorded (there is no need to store a file and its gzipped version, or TMP files, in the PROCESSED_DATA tree). Thus, the software could be improved along these lines, IMHO.

The fluorescence detector did not work, so our experiments were restricted to SAD.","Very nice lunch and rest area, very well equipped (better than in other sited :).

The recent enhancements to the end-station (manipulator motorization and analysis chamber camera) are excellent, although one might want to consider installing safety stoppers to the lid and gate valve between prep and analysis chamber. Now it's too easy to crash the manipulator since one is often sitting in the hutch during long z movements. A safety stopper switch in the gate valve (and lid) would stop the z movement before the manipulator rod hits it. 

Manipulator control software had minor bugs and the SES computer was somewhat sluggish, but these were minor inconveniences. 

The sample transfer and storage system is impressive in its simplicity and reliability. In total we measured 26 samples and there were absolutely no problems transferring samples in and out.

I can also only give one star for the instrument as the automated realignment process did not work effectively. Thus I lost about half of the beam intensity and could not recover it. I decided not to call out the beamline scientist, as i did not realize how big the problem was in the beginning and i did not want to loose half a day for the realignment. However, the two problems, the unstable beam and the lack of intensity, in combination meant that the data quality was poor. I realize that i should probably have called out the beamline scientist to try and fix the alignment problem, but i was worried that i would loose the too much time in the end. Also, the lack of intensity, though unfortunately, would not have been as big a problem as it ended up being if the beam had been stable.",,"Despite that most of the things are rated relatively high I can only give one star in total as the problems with the unstable beam coming from the ring and the problems with automatic realignment of the instrument overshadowed all the good things, cos it meant that the data collected was of a poorer quality that normally, when i visit maxlab.

There was a problem of the manipulator at the end station two weeks ago before our beamtime. During our experimental time, the manipulator cannot be moved vertically, which is critical for the alignment of sample to the incident beam. We tried several days with different methods, i.e., tuning analyzer lens voltage, inserting pieces of metal with different thicknesses between sample and holder, and so on, but we failed to resolve the problem. We can get some photoelectron signal in SCIENTA, but the intensity is more than two orders of magnitude lower than normal operation, the resolution is more than twice worse even with very small beam slit. On June 14 afternoon, there was technical staffs to check the manipulator, but they only had chance on June 17 to remove the manipulator to examine the problem.

The staff managed everything OK, especially, if we take into account that the machine was not performing at its best. A major remark about the beamline is regarding the absence of different options of holders. For instance, we believe that they could have more options for sample holders, for capillaries with different sizes and also with a larger number of places (we could scan only 4 capillaries each time). The presence of self-guided screws, in order to reproduce the positioning of the holder would be great and, allied with holders with the exact size of the used capillaries, would save time. In fact, in the current set up, we lose much time to scan and place the capillaries in the good place in front of the beam and in our case it was common found differences of almost 0.5 mm each time.

The beam had some disturbances at the beamline but only for a couple of hours.  Most of the 24 hours the beam was stable enough for data collection.

We experienced that the flowcell was relatively dirty in the middle of the beamtime. During reinjection the flowcell was cleaned with hellmanex, meaning that there might be some issues in comparing data collected before and after cleaning as it is expected that the residuals left in the flowcell interact with the measured sample.

The program of measurements was much altered to essentially focus only on x-ray absorption. An attempt at high resolution O K-edge XES from other samples was made, but as the emission calibration test using a Na Kalpha line in second order indicated a very oddly distributed vertical focussing of the beam giving rise to three distinct emission sources, it was clear that high resolution XES was impossible without other measures. To compensate for slitless operation, a slit was mounted on one of the samples, but alignment and countrate issues prevented any useful measurements. 

Finally, the XAS measurements themselves were hampered as the sample stick was not electrically isolated to allow for sample drain TEY measurements. The alternative sample stick which allowed for sample drain TEY had such a limited range of x-y movement, that it proved impossible to do grazing incidence measurements onto these sample surfaces. The resultant XAS measurements using the first sample stick required separate scans for TEY and TFY, both obtained by the channeltron detector in differing polarities. Unfortunately for the samples that optically fluoresced the TEY was compromised by the contribution of the TFY signal. Interpretation has proven difficult for these.",,09/07/2013

A solution was not found, so we did our measurements with ca. 1/3 of the intensity we would normally expect, however we got reasonable data. We lost the last day due to a crash of the computer running the diffractometer which could not be fixed on Sunday afternoon.

We see a problem with the way the data handling is done. To be able to integrate the 2D files, they first have to be converted to a readable format. To do this conversion, the files need to be transferred to a second computer, and then back to do the integration. This is time consuming and means that online data analysis cannot be done. This destroys the flow in measurement/analysis. We could improve our efficiency during beamtime if this was not the case.

During our beamtime , MAXII was running at 200 mA instead of 250. 

The intensity of the beam oscillates with time (period of a couple of minutes) and we have to take care of this in our datanalysis, however this is not a new problem.
