Hello everyone!

Ana from MAX IV gave us the mission to make it easier for them to handle user feedback.

A lot of scientists use MAX IV and they are all asked to fill in this [s] survey.

It has some numerical scores and some text fields. 

The numerical scores are naturally easy to measure, but often the interesting feedback is in the comments. Because that's were people mention things that could be improved but they didn't think to include a question for.

But the spreadsheet generated by this looks like this [s]. Around 8-9 hundred comments spread across  2062 rows.
And the people at Max IV have more important this to do that combing through this.

[s]
So the goal of our project has been to make a tool that can identify the topics the comments are talking about, and if they are talking about them positively or negatively.
Then show what people are saying in a focused and clean way.

Demonstration:

Describe interface
word list
	tfidf features
	filtered to nouns and adjectives
	also bigrams
sentences where words appear
	outline indicate if it came from a positive or negative comment
highlighting
	made to draw the eye
	currently works better on adjectives
	made using the langforia dependency parser

Words are filtered to only nouns and adjectives to avoid useless words like "did" or "saw"

Most comments are good, so negative coefficients just means "not as excellent as excellent"

we have accidentally made an API

possible improvements:
	Button to show whole comment and details
	Some word scoring other than coefficients, because they are limiting us to logistic regression.
	controls for filtering which words and comments are included and how they are sorted.
		for example only negative/positive or only nouns
	handle negations

End on a positive
what we've learned
	machine learning with scikit-learn
	Word embedding
